<blockquote style='margin-bottom:1.5em'>
<p style='font-style:italic; text-indent:0'>Though the Government officials hushed up
the discovery, fearing that it might lead to an “utter
disorganization of society,” gold will out&mdash;and when it came out
Australia experienced a stampede of the wildest sort, with
nuggets of wondrous size and fortunes picked up over
night.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a celebration at the Stag’s Head
saloon, Downieville, Sierra County, California. A dozen or more
gold-seekers from the
nearby bars on the Yuba River were on
hand to say good-by to “Sailor” Hargraves. The great California
gold rush of 1849 was approaching its crest. “The
City,” as San Francisco was known throughout the diggings,
was overflowing with wealth. Crowds of red-shirted miners from
the creeks, anxious to exchange their dust for
something&mdash;anything&mdash;anything that caught their eye&mdash;met and
mingled with the vast horde of adventurers drawn from all parts
of the world. From the over-taxed saloons came the droning cry,
“Money on the bar,” indicating a lucky man inviting
the world to celebrate with him.</p>

<p>Even Downieville, born only a few months
before, was bubbling with excitement. The guest of the evening,
Edward Hargraves, was returning to Australia with the avowed
intention of discovering a goldfield even greater than that of
California. Like many others, he had come hotfoot to the
California diggings one year before. He had not been successful
as a miner, this soldier, sailor and bushman. Perhaps he was
more of a talker than a worker. He certainly had a flair for the
theatrical and was given to boasting of Australia.</p>

<p>Half a century before this little
farewell celebration took place, England’s political heads were
puzzling over what to do with a huge island in the Southern
Seas. A penal colony! Good idea! So for fifty years she had
dumped her convicts there&mdash;some cut-throats of the lowest type,
others misguided idealists who had queer political views. As a
result about one-half of the population of Australia were either
convicts or “emancipists”&mdash;the latter, convicts who had
served their terms but were not permitted to return to the
motherland.</p>

<p>“Even if you did discover a
goldfield in Australia, Hargraves, that old queen of yours
wouldn’t let you have the gold,” an emancipist from
Australia sneered, while Hargraves boasted.</p>

<p>“Queen Victoria, God bless her, will
be informed that I have discovered a great goldfield and will
make me one of her Gold Commissioners and perhaps afterward a
peer of the realm,” Hargraves replied, striking an
attitude.</p>

<p>Curiously enough a large part of this
childish boast was destined to come true!</p>

<p>Arrived in Sydney, New South Wales,
Hargraves tried to induce old friends and acquaintances to put
up funds for him to make an expedition into the
“back-blocks” to discover a goldfield. He pointed out
that he had just come from California and was an expert at both
discovering and washing gold. His friends refused to put their
money into such a wild speculation. Nothing daunted, he invested
the few dollars that represented all his capital in a saddle
horse. He then rode across the Blue Mountains, through Bathurst,
to Guyong, where he picked up a native guide and plunged into
the wilderness.</p>

<p>About fifteen miles from the settlement,
at a point on Lewis Pond’s Creek, a tributary of the McQuarie
River, the two men prepared their first meal. Having eaten,
Hargraves, probably regretting that he had no larger audience,
informed the native of the object of their expedition. The eyes
of the “blackfellow” bulged with excitement. This
slight encouragement was sufficient to cause Hargraves to get to
his feet. “Right where we are now resting is a
goldfield,” he announced. “It is all about us. I will
prove it to you.”</p>

<p>He took a dishpan and washed a pan of
dirt. It showed a few grains of gold! In all he washed five pans
in rapid succession and four of them showed colors. Later he
admitted that his talk had been bluff; he had only hoped that
gold was there!</p>

<p>A few weeks later, Hargraves walked into
the office of the Honorable Deas-Thompson, Colonial Secretary,
at Sydney, and opened a mysterious paper package. The official
was in a cheerful frame of mind. He listened to his visitor with
patience and good humor.</p>

<p>“By Jove, my man, it is gold!”
he finally exclaimed, adjusting his eyeglasses. “I believe
your story. I will have it investigated.”</p>


<p class='sb'>Hargraves’ dramatic discovery was not the first
time gold had been talked of in Australia. Nearly thirty years
before, one of the convicts at Botany Bay showed a specimen of
gold-splashed quartz he claimed he had found. When asked to show
the place of discovery, he was unable to find it again and was
awarded one hundred and fifty lashes for his “deception.” A few
years later a gang of convicts building a road through the Blue
Mountains found a number of gold specimens, but the news was
promptly suppressed because it was feared that the convicts
would get out of hand.</p>

<p>In 1841, ten years before Hargraves
returned from California, a bushman named Adam Forres found a
good size nugget and showed it to W. B. Clarke, a geologist.
Clarke took it to Governor Gipps, who dismissed the matter by
saying, “Put it away, Mr. Clarke, put it away, or we shall all
have our throats cut.” Clarke thereupon advised his friends, who
were excited about the find, that he would not make it public as
he feared it might lead to the “utter disorganization of
society.”</p>

<p>The investigation of Hargraves’ discovery
promised by Secretary Deas-Thompson took place. Again the
official mind was stubborn!</p>

<p>“I can see no evidence whatever of
the precious metal in the district indicated,” Mr. Stutchburg,
the Government geologist, reported.</p>

<p>But Hargraves was so earnest and so
insistent that the geologist made a second visit and watched
Hargraves wash out a dozen pans of dirt, several of which showed
a string of colors. Moreover, half a dozen men who had caught
the trick from “the forty-niner” were panning on the creek and
showing colors in pan after pan. The geologist was forced to
admit the gold was there. The news was reported in the press.
The stampede was on! What a Government geologist said or thought
did not matter now; he was brushed aside like a chip in the
wind. Within a few days four hundred amateur miners were milling
around the spot where Hargraves had washed his historic pan of
dirt.</p>

<p>Before Hargraves’ find was fully
accepted, two new fields were discovered, one on the Turon River
and another on the Abercrombie, and these were followed almost
immediately by the “Kerr strike.” At a little sheep station on
the banks of the Merro River, a “blackboy” horsebreaker, idly
chipping at a quartz boulder, struck harder than he had intended
and split the rock, revealing to his astonished gaze a core of
solid gold bigger than his fist. Two other similar boulders were
promptly broken up, bringing to light even larger chunks of
solid gold. One of these, had it remained unbroken, probably
would have been the biggest sample of native gold in the
world.</p>

<p>The news ran through Australia like
wildfire. Within a few weeks from almost every point of the
compass reports of new discoveries were coming in, one on the
heels of the other. There were:</p>

<table style='margin-left:20%; border-collapse:collapse;'>
<tr><td>Clunes</td><td>on July 8th</td></tr>
<tr><td>Buninyong</td><td>on August 8th</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anderson’s Creek</td><td>on August 11th</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ballarat</td><td>on September 8th</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mount Alexander</td><td>on September 10th</td></tr>
<tr><td>Broken River</td><td>on September 29th</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Four of these discoveries became great
producers. Mount Alexander, for instance, produced more than ten
thousand ounces of gold in the first fifteen days of existence.
Any man with a spade and tin dish could be a successful miner.
Indeed, few knew anything of mining, shown by the fact that many
claims were abandoned and re-abandoned only to yield fortunes to
second and third comers. One such abandoned claim, the “Poor
Boy” at Eureka, yielded a nugget of pure gold weighing over six
hundred ounces. In another instance, a pillar of earth, left as
a support in a deserted claim at Bendigo, calved a nugget
weighing more than five hundred ounces.</p>

<p>The effect of these discoveries was
two-fold; to the officials, it was a calamity; to the masses, it
was a windfall. The officials saw in it only a possible uprising
of the convicts and demoralization of the laboring classes. The
Commissioner of Lands at Bathurst, hearing of Hargraves’
activities, sent a special message to the governor advising
“that steps be taken to prevent the working classes from
deserting their regular employment for the goldfields.” Gold, to
the masses, spelled quick fortunes and trade revival.</p>

<p>Australia had been passing through a
period of great commercial depression. People were drifting
away, especially to California. The gold strike was a lifesaver.
First timidly, then boldly, committees of wealthy citizens
offered cash rewards for gold discoveries. Men, women and
children gave part or all of their time to the search, often
looking in the most unlikely places, yet sometimes not without
results. A stagecoach driver in his spare time found the
Ding-Dong deposits and realized a fortune.</p>


<p class='sb'>It was as if some electric shock ran
through every town, village and house in Australia.
Almost the entire male population poured along the roads that
led to the goldfields. Men forsook their ordinary vocations. The
shearer left the sheep station; the driver his team; lawyers and
even judges forsook their courts; the merchant his
counting-house, and the clerks their desks. Geelong, Melbourne
and Sydney became almost empty towns. In Hobson’s Bay on January
6th, 1852, there lay forty-seven merchant ships abandoned by
their crews, who had set out for the goldfields to wash a
fortune out of a tin dish. The police resigned in scores; even
warders in lunatic asylums left their patients. Business reached
a standstill. Schools were closed. In some places not a man was
left.</p>

<p>At Melbourne, out of forty-four
constables, only two remained on duty. The governor issued a
circular to department heads in Sydney, asking how they were
affected by the gold “disturbance.” The police chief reported,
“Although a great increase of pay has been offered, fifty of my
fifty-five constables have gone to the goldfields.” The
postmaster, “An entire disruption has taken place in this
department and immediate measures must be taken.” The harbor
master reported, “I have only one man left.”</p>

<p>Society was cast into the melting pot;
all disappeared over the rim of the horizon in a breathless race
to where they had been told gold nuggets were being dug up like
potatoes. Thus had the whisper of gold risen to a shout of gold,
and it ran round the world and turned the stems of ships on
every sea toward Australia. It was the day of the clipper ships
of New England, and their skippers went after this new trade
with Yankee keenness.</p>

<p>During this time passenger traffic
between Australia and San Francisco was greater than it has ever
been since&mdash;Australians stampeding to California and
Californians rushing to Australia. In five months eleven
thousand immigrants passed through the principal Australian
ports. In the next four years over four hundred thousand
immigrants arrived, almost all drawn there by the lure of
gold.</p>

<p>After the first rush to the diggings had
subsided the cities began to fill up again. Supplies for the new
mining camps became a commercial factor, and this, together with
the handling of the horde of overseas stampeders, caused a big
expansion in business. Then when the miners began to take their
vacations from the diggings, these Australian cities, formerly
quiet sheep towns, experienced their first period of rushing
business and wild extravagance.</p>

<p>The lucky diggers became the outstanding
figures of local society. Their wagerings at the race track or
gaming table put former plungers into the shade. They imported
the world’s best race-horses, the world’s largest diamonds, and
built fine homes. Until that time the wealthy in Australia were
almost exclusively the “official” class, aristocrats from
England, but with the coming of gold men rose from poverty to
wealth almost overnight and the old social lines were thrust
aside. The forceful and hard-fisted bosses of the mining camps
became the leaders and dominators of commerce, finance and
society.</p>

<p>As in American get-rich-quick
communities, a plague of human parasites began to infest these
easy-money centers. Bands of bushrangers sprang into existence
and preyed upon the traffic between the goldfields and the
cities, but the authorities, if slow, were sure. They stamped
out crime with a deadly thoroughness that cowed the rough
element. Hold-up&mdash;“robbery under arms” it was called&mdash;was a crime
punishable by death. Australia’s period of lawlessness, in many
ways romantic and interesting, was of short duration. The
citizens formed no Vigilance Committees. Putting down crime was
left to the Mounted Police, and they made a good job of
it.</p>


<p class='sb'>The returns in the first few months
after gold was discovered made a dazzling record. The first
dolly set rocking at Golden Point yielded four and one-half
pounds of gold in two hours. At Canadian Valley, in the same
district, the wash and rubble yielded an average of about
thirty-five pounds weight of gold per claim. At Blacksmith’s
Hole, on the Canadian River, one party of mates in one day
obtained over fifteen hundred dollars per man, the average of
the claim being one ounce of gold to every bucket of earth. This
claim was worked twice after being abandoned and in all yielded
more than one ton in weight of the precious metal.</p>

<p>From one fraction, only twelve feet by
twelve feet, at Gravel Bend, one hundred and twenty-five pounds
weight of gold was taken out in less than thirty days. Another
syndicate of eight men, working nearby, pocketed one hundred and
seventy-five thousand dollars. The Prince claim was leased for
one week and yielded about eighty thousand dollars; then, for a
two-week period, yielding forty-five thousand dollars. Before
the end of the year 1851 over thirty thousand miners were
working in the Victoria goldfields. In the following year this
province alone yielded gold to the value of forty-eight million
dollars, and in the succeeding year one hundred and five million
dollars, and this golden flood spelled prosperity to the whole
of Australia.</p>

<p>Australia too, startled the imagination
of the world by the large size of the chunks of gold
occasionally found. For several years the industry of mining was
mostly a matter of luck. It was a tenderfoot’s paradise. Barbers
had equal chance with geologists, and jockeys with experienced
miners. There is no other example in the history of mining such
a succession of great nuggets. One expert has made a calculation
of the world’s famous nuggets, one hundred and fifty in number.
Of these one hundred and nineteen were found in Australia, the
United States trailing along a poor second with only
nine.</p>

<p>The “Welcome Stranger” nugget, found at
Dunolly, only a few inches below the surface, was a block of
gold twenty-four inches long and ten inches thick and yielded
two thousand, two hundred and forty-eight ounces of pure gold,
valued at just under forty-nine thousand dollars. The “Welcome”
nugget, found at Ballarat, weighed two thousand, two hundred and
seventeen ounces and was sold for forty-six thousand dollars.
The “Blanche Barkly,” picked up at Kingower, at a depth of only
fifteen feet, yielded seventeen hundred and forty-three ounces
and was worth thirty-four thousand dollars. Another, weighing
sixteen hundred and nineteen ounces, was part of a small rock
slide that rolled into Canadian Gully.</p>

<p>This nugget was picked up by a widow just
out from England and forthwith sold for twenty-six thousand
dollars. This fortunate woman was of the stuff that make real
pioneers. She had a family to support and, hearing of the
Australian goldfields, she stowed her family aboard a sailing
ship and came&mdash;and in the fifties a voyage more than half way
around the world was no picnic. It could be said of her in
truth, “She came; she saw; she conquered”&mdash;for the finding of
this nugget was only the beginning.</p>

<p>“What any man can do, I can do,” she
said, and she did, both in Australia and in England, where, for
thirty years after, she was a power in financial and social
circles.</p>

<p>And what of the original stampeders? Few
of the world’s adventurers have been more suitably rewarded than
was Edward Hammond Hargraves, officially recognized as the
discoverer of gold in Australia. He gained wealth, a good
position and a title, wore showy uniforms and became a public
functionary, surrounded by an army of satellites. He received
the appointment of Commissioner of Crown Lands. The British
Government bestowed upon him a gift of fifty thousand dollars.
The Government of Victoria a gift of twenty-five thousand
dollars. New South Wales gave him a life pension of two thousand
five hundred dollars per annum. Hargraves became a great
man.</p>

<p>Of the others, Thomas Hiscock, who
discovered Ballarat, died before he enjoyed much material
reward. Harry Frenchman, discoverer of Golden Gully at Bendigo,
became a wealthy woolman. Fortescue, the brilliant emancipist
attorney, tossed away a fortune in the cause of his oppressed
brethren in Ireland, but died poor. Marshal owned race-horses,
envied alike by English peers and South African magnates. Nat
Bayley and Charles Ford, the pair who later found gold in
Western Australia, retired with great wealth.</p>

<p>The Australian gold rush must be reckoned
among the world’s great stampedes, one which yielded huge prizes
to the few and good prizes for nearly all who had the high
courage and cool foresight to take a chance.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='all:initial; display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
